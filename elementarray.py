'''units: what units are used? Constant values such as
initial value or rate of decay or wind speed are all dependent
on what units are being discussed.

distance: meter
time: second
pollutant concentration: some number of particles per cubic meter?

The physical location of the element, and relationships such
as which elements are neighboring other elements, will be
tracked by the element array, not the individual elements themselves.
